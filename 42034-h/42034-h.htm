<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>Most of the poems collected in this volume have already seen the light
of print in the <i>Colonnade</i>, the monthly publication of the Andiron Club
of New York University. The effort of the author has not been to write
verses especially adapted to the taste of the modern public, but rather
to create "a thing of beauty" from the theme that filled his mind at the
time. Often he has been led into somewhat bold innovations such as the
invention of the miniature ode, and the associating of an idea with a
rime-<i>motiv</i> in the metrical short-stories. While he hopes that the new
forms will justify themselves, he realizes that after all, the poems
must stand or fall in proportion to the amount of pure artistic beauty
contained within them.</p>

<h2>"CARPE DIEM"</h2>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="table">
<tr><td>
Wake, love; Aurora's breath has tinged the sky,<br />
Mounting in faintly flushing shafts on high<br />
To tell the world that Ph&oelig;bus is at hand;<br />
And all the hours in a glittering band<br />
Cluster around in sweeping, circling flight<br />
Like angels bathing in celestial light.<br />
See, now with one great shaft of molten gold,<br />
No longer vaporous haze around him rolled,<br />
The King of Day mounts the ethereal height,<br />
Scattering the last dim streamers of the night.<br />
Bow down, ye Persians, on your altared hills;<br />
Worship the Sun-god who gives life, and fills<br />
Your horn with plenteous blessings from on high.<br />
Wake! Wake! before the dawning sunbeams die!<br />
Fling incense on your temple's dying flame;<br />
Sing chants and chorals in his mighty name,<br />
For as a weary traveler from afar,<br />
Or as a sailor on the harbor bar<br />
After long absence spies his native town,<br />
So, with benignant brilliance smiles he down;<br />
Or, like a good king ruling o'er his land,<br />
He sprinkles blessings with a bounteous hand.<br />
And thou, O my beloved, wake! arise!<br />
Has not the sun illumined night's dull skies?<br />
Come, Ph&oelig;bus' breath has tinged the summer morn.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span><br />
Come, see the light shafts waver 'mong the corn.<br />
Come, see the early lily's opening bloom.<br />
Come, see the wavering light expel the gloom<br />
From yon dark vale still sunk in misty night.<br />
Oh, watch the circling skylark's heavenward flight,<br />
As, wrapped in hazy waves of shimmering light,<br />
In one grand Jubilate to the sun,<br />
He floods the sky with song of day begun.<br />
But golden morn is never truly fair<br />
Unless with day, thou com'st to weave my hair<br />
With perfumed flowers gathered in the dell<br />
Where sylphs sing sweetly 'bout the bubbling well.<br />
Oh, fill my cup of pleasure with new wine<br />
Which sparkles only where thy soft eyes shine!<br />
O my beloved, haste thee to arise<br />
Before the light has scorched the noonday skies!<br />
The fleeting hours haste the falling sun;<br />
And soon the hour-glass of life is run.<br />

<h2>THE SONG OF LORENZO</h2>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="table">
<tr><td>
Over thy balcony leaning,<br />
Thy languorous glance floats below<br />
Whence arise thousand odours a-streaming,<br />
Thine incense, O goddess of woe!<br />
<br />
A star from the infinite whirling,<br />
Taking flight through the dimness of night,<br />
In an ark through the ether is curling;<br />
And touches thy hair with its light.<br />
<br />
O lady of sadness and sorrow,<br />
Mine anguish, my hope, my despair,<br />
Will the bright-dawning day of to-morrow<br />
Find thee still in that balcony there?<br />
<br />
Near thy casement, an ancient vine groweth,<br />
A ladder that leads thee below;<br />
Were it not for that vine, ah, who knoweth<br />
Thou wert not an <i>angel</i> of woe?<br />
<br />
Come down from thy cloud-bosomed chamber;<br />
Not yet has the moon lit the sky;<br />
On the vine-trellis, carefully, clamber&mdash;<br />
(Is it thou or the wind that doth sigh?)<br />
<br />
Among the copse hedges then darting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span><br />
Like a ghost at the dawn of the day;<br />
Then, far in the distance departing,<br />
In triumph, I'll bear thee away.<br />

<h2>THE SONG OF WO HOU</h2>

<h3><i>From the Second Act of Kwang Hsu</i></h3>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="table">
<tr><td>
List, O list to the song I sing<br />
To the varying note of the sighing breeze<br />
Blowing in cool, refreshing waves<br />
From the endless realm of the seven seas:<br />
<br />
Waste not life in pursuit of war,<br />
Holding the nations for one short day,<br />
For the death of the king destroys the realm<br />
Which vanishes like the great Mongol's sway.<br />
<br />
Nor hoard up silver in thy vaults,<br />
For the silver once spent, the pleasure is passed,<br />
Or before it is spent, we will mourn thy death:<br />
In the world, neither conquest nor silver last.<br />
<br />
Seek, O seek but an hour's joy;<br />
Pleasure and love though they may not endure<br />
Will soothe life's sorrow and bitterness&mdash;<br />
The present alone of all time is sure!<br />
<br />
Live in the circle of mine arms;<br />
Live in the light of the love in mine eye;<br />
Live in the music of my song;<br />
And, as the music of my song&mdash;die!<br />

<h2>THE AURORA</h2>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="table">

Night in purple fringed with the faintest crimson<br />
Conquered the slowly paling glow of sunset;<br />
Softly the western light expired; and yet<br />
Came there no stars forth&mdash;<br />
<br />
O'er the tow'ring cliffs and the vales and waters,<br />
O'er the whisp'ring woodland of swaying hemlocks,<br />
O'er the streamlets trickling down on the crag-rocks,<br />
Came there no moon forth.<br />
<br />
Rose in distance, a dim and fearful spectre;<br />
Rose, accompanied by the forest's singing,<br />
An omen of evil, certainty bringing<br />
Of the divine wroth&mdash;<br />
<br />
Far from northern forests descends some army;<br />
Far in the heavens, their fires are reflected;<br />
Waver the lights in an archway collected,<br />
Sign of divine wroth&mdash;<br />
<br />
Shines the arch in a flick'ring wavy brilliance;<br />
Lighting earth from its quivering span of silver;<br />
Shines the Aurora soft o'er lake and river,<br />
Shines from the far north.<br />

<h2>THE WILL O' THE WISP</h2>

Over the moorland, over the moor,<br />
Sibilant sounds the rain-storm's sneer,<br />
Sneeringly sounds, yet with a lure<br />
Like the lure of the mermaids of the mere,<br />
Calling the fishermen into their snare&mdash;<br />
Through watery veils, my dim eyes peer,<br />
Where can a light or a path be, where?<br />
Lost on the moor, the moorland drear&mdash;<br />
Lost, and the storm-lion's out of his lair,<br />
Raging rampant with mighty roar;<br />
And the glistening lightning flashes its glare;<br />
And the torrents descend with a wind-driven pour.<br />
Only the lightning to show by its fire<br />
The tears of Heaven flooding Earth's floor;<br />
And, above the sound of the storm-lion's ire,<br />
Shriek the rain-sheets over the tor,<br />
Shriek in a quavering, tuneless choir.<br />
What's that in the distance shining afar?<br />
See it flickering higher and higher,<br />
Light in a broadening, lengthening bar&mdash;<br />
Who is abroad at this lonely hour?<br />
Or is it a cottage high on the scar?<br />
Or does it shine in My Lady's tower<br />
To guide her Lord from lands afar?<br />
Nearer and nearer, I haste&mdash;Oh, for power<br />
To reach that light&mdash;Oh, to be sure,<br />
My Lady would welcome me in her bower&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span><br />

Through life he strove to reach his longed-for goal,<br />
Living secluded in a forest dell;<br />
It was his wish to learn himself so well<br />
As to command the secrets of the soul;<br />
He studied, wrote, and fashioned out life's scroll<br />
Until the spirit's instincts could he spell;<br />
And then at last diapason swell,<br />
Burst forth his writings, 'round the world to roll!<br />
As organ music sighs through cloistered aisle,<br />
As mighty calms upon the waters steal,<br />
As raging, shrieking tempest-blasts assail;<br />
So doth his magic word our minds beguile<br />
Until, swept onward by each peal on peal,<br />
Our souls are lured beyond this mortal veil.<br />

<h2>THE VISION OF DANTE</h2>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="table">
<tr><td>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon my breast there weighed ten thousand waves</span><br />
Of black, unthinkable despair; I floated<br />
In atmosphere of leaden density,<br />
In atmosphere that burned with heat, yet glowed not&mdash;<br />
Then scintillating stars with vivid flashes,<br />
Like sparks from steel struck in a mine's thick blackness,<br />
Tortured my eyes with dazzling glare; and then<br />
Arose a rumbling as of crashing tombs<br />
When the dead waken. Gone my will, my power.<br />
I could nor feel, nor move, nor cry. Creation<br />
Seemed rending downward through eternal space.<br />
The thundering ceased, there shot a wail of pain,<br />
A wail more anguished than arose from Troy<br />
When Hector fell. Fainter, it grew, receding<br />
Through the spheres. The meteors flashed no more.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I floated upward on invisible wings;</span><br />
The distance purpled in the glow of dawn;<br />
Funereal clouds melted to shimmering gray;<br />
And far away the notes of music sounded,<br />
Echoing onward to Infinity&mdash;<br />
Music celestial of that choir of Heaven<br />
Which sings unendingly about His throne.<br />
Distant, it floated, yet how pure, and clearer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span><br />
Than clear, rebounding Alpine notes. A present<br />
Foretaste of the sublime beatitudes;<br />
And o'er my visual sky moved forms of beings,<br />
Dark forms in solemn, slow-ascending flight<br />
Toward that rich, purple glow. The vision changed:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So pure the light that darkness sealed my eyelids!</span><br />
So grand the symphony, I could not hear!<br />
The whole cathedral-vault of Heaven rang<br />
In awful majesty of perfect tone;<br />
And 'past my mortal vision, in endless tide,<br />
Flowing, and flowing upward toward the Light,<br />
Angels innumerable, many-hued,<br />
Winged on, majestic, to the music's time,<br />
Winged on and sang a ceaseless Hallelujah&mdash;<br />

Machine to govern man. You build a tower<br />

Lost in a race with no competitor,<br />

And then the Great Intelligence&mdash;if such<br />
There be&mdash;will see his moment's pastime o'er,<br />
And turn his arts to other constellations,<br />
Until in rolling æons e'en his mind<br />
May lose the memory of Man which <i>was</i>&mdash;<br />

Love-wrought line of scented rapture, none<br />
Subtler to woo the honey-hunting swarm.<br />
Let me sigh out my soul in ecstasy,<br />
And breathe forth all the fragrance of my being<br />
Upon the slowly-stirring summer air;<br />
Let me no longer merely scent, hear, see;<br />
But <i>one</i> with Nature, in that Law agreeing&mdash;<br />
That God-willed Law that tincts the Beauty there&mdash;<br />

<h2>AFTER THE NEO-PLATONISTS</h2>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="table">
<tr><td>
Night wove her web across the sun that died<br />
In crimson colors; velvet-falling gloom<br />
Hung curtain-wise, and, like some rich perfume,<br />
Formed the soft essence of each wind that sighed.<br />
Out of my casement through the dark, I spied<br />
The moon afloat in tide of golden spume<br />
Like some fair flower opening into bloom;<br />
The earth lay dim; the Heavens starry-eyed;<br />
And breezes softer than a maiden's breath<br />
Hushed all the air. O night, how sweet thy charm!<br />
Yet not thy moon, nor stars, nor wind, each one<br />
Of these shall pass when we are changed by death&mdash;<br />
But rather sleep, thou death-in-life, more warm<br />
Yet not so sweet as sweet oblivion.<br />

What wouldst thou be? A cloud upon the air<br />
Of summer skies afloat in sunlit charm,<br />
And drinking azure bliss, all free from care,<br />

Of thousand terrors through the throbbing night,<br />
And filling earth with fear and vague surprise<br />
To gaze upon thy bright, liquescent light?<br />
What wouldst thou be? A sullen, stalwart cliff<br />
Immovable upon a grassy plain,<br />
Kissed by no clouds, and cold, and stark, and stiff,<br />
Unmelted by the gentle tears of rain?<br />

<h2>THE PROPHECY OF DAVID</h2>

<h3>A METRICAL SHORT-STORY</h3>


<h3>I</h3>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="table">
<tr><td>
"The prophecy is overthrown at last!<br />
Thy hopes, my fury-tempered steel shall blast.<br />
Mine, mine, thou art; David, thou shalt not rule.<br />
This curse upon my seed is overpassed;<br />
And he who made it was some dream-crazed fool<br />
Whose soul was such poor stuff as could not mast<br />
Futurity's wide ocean. David shall be<br />
All fetter-bound, my captive prisoned fast!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Before his tent, King Saul in triumph strode;</span><br />
About Prince David circled his array.<br />
E'er the new sun had sipped the dew, would he<br />
Close on the fugitive.&mdash;"Brain-crazing thirst<br />
Of jealousy that drives me on my way<br />
Of torment, drain this cup; and satiate be.<br />
Thy hope, O line of David, fadeth fast<br />
Like pallid starlight into morning cast."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Saul triumphed to the stars; he gasped for air</span><br />
As one might gasp upon a mountain's height.<br />
Revenge and hate swept storm-like through the lair<br />
Where lurked his soul shrinking before the blast;<br />
"Mine, mine, by high-enthroned Jehovah's might!"<br />
The words upon his lips were hot and fast.&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span><br />
Thine, thine, thou say'st? Him shalt thou never gain!<br />
Thou dream'st a dream, O King; it is in vain.<br />
Once fixed, the star of forecast cannot wane.<br />
Thine, thine, thou say'st? It is in vain, in vain.&mdash;<br />
Was it the echo tortured into shape<br />
Of his own words? Still stood the King aghast.<br />
Did all this prisoning world leave no escape<br />
From evil prophecy to his sworn vow?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He clapped his hands. (How the two sounds contrast!)</span><br />
A servant came who cringed before his brow.<br />
"Whence came that sighing voice? Let no one go<br />
About my tent." The man was silent. "Now,<br />
My Lord?" he quavered. "All has been quite still."<br />
Saul's forehead frowned: "Return to rest&mdash;Or no,<br />
Order my men to muster; 'tis my will<br />
To seize the enemy at once, before<br />
The light of morn. Soon shall I hold my foe;<br />
And when he's bolted safe by gates thick-brassed,<br />
Then may my fury gorge its dread repast."<br />
Again he smiled. Footsteps approached in sore,<br />
Short-tempered strides as one who comes from far.<br />
Still paused the servant for Saul's nod to go&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span><br />
And Saul was smiling to the moon's curved bar.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"My Lord, my Lord, these tidings brook no pause!"</span><br />
As if unwillingly, the King turned slow.<br />
"Philistines plunder thy rich-garnered grain,<br />
And flood thy fencèd towns with waves of fire!<br />
The land is overswept with bloody rain;<br />
Thy towered throne is tottering to the mire!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Saul's fingers clenched until the blood was near;</span><br />
He turned away; the moon was hid from sight.<br />
Only upon Prince David's men one gleam<br />
Pierced through the gloomy, cypress-shaded night.<br />
"Lost, lost&mdash;so near, and yet in vain, in vain&mdash;"<br />
His enemy who should displace his son,<br />
Would still live on while he must go and fight<br />
To save the realm&mdash;save, for this hated one?<br />
He spoke; his voice was tense: "Awake my men;<br />
We must be marching far." A lightening beam<br />
Of anguish flashed and re-flashed through his brain;<br />
And back there floated in his oral ken:<br />
"Once fixed, the star of forecast cannot wane;<br />
Thine, thine, thou say'st? Him shalt thou never gain!"</td></tr></table>

<h3>II</h3>

<tr><td>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Encamped Philistines lay upon the plain</span><br />
While Israel held the barren hillock's rise.<br />
Like palm trees in the waste, their gay tents shone;<br />
And many camp-fires vied with sunset skies,<br />
Yet fewer on the hills than blazed below<br />
Down in the darkening valley where had grown<br />
As many flickering lights as flakes of snow<br />
That fall on wintry Lebanus.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">Alone</span><br />
Before his tent, strode Saul; his head was bowed<br />
As bows a palm tree to the tempest blast.<br />
Was this deep thought? Or was the spirit cowed<br />
By some high-topping terror? Then at last<br />
Tensely he spoke as to the blackening cloud<br />
That hung above the sunset: "I, so strong,<br />
Yet cannot banish thee, ill-omened shroud,<br />
That round my writhing soul wraps as a pall<br />
Of mute foreboding?&mdash;He and Philistine join<br />
In lowering hate against me on the plain&mdash;<br />
God, God, my soul has sought Thy soul; wherein<br />
But Thine Omnipotence can triumph lie?<br />
Yet Thou art wordless.&mdash;Shall the King still call<br />
Unto the Silent?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">The clouds were scudding fast</span><br />
As if breathed through the Heavens by God's sigh.<br />
There turned his eyes; then o'er the valley cast.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span><br />
"Yet will I win," he cried. "Fate cannot last.<br />
The days are all at odds; the powers conspire<br />
To crush my mortal Will. Oh, I will cast,<br />
And trample dim foreboding in the mire!<br />
Let Fate come on; I'll meet him half the way;<br />
And win&mdash;&mdash;" Ceased in the air his words.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Sudden,</span><br />
The sky grew dark; a frail gust stirred the fire,<br />
Filling the air with monotone of woe:<br />
"Thou dream'st a dream; it is in vain, in vain;<br />
Him never shalt thou gain&mdash;&mdash;" The sound was flown.<br />
With features fury-tortured, hands clenched fast,<br />
Up leaped he, straining arms stretched forth.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">"My foe</span><br />
I'll rend, rend, rend; hear me ye breeze's blast!<br />
My royal root shall bloom; and David&mdash;lost.<br />
Jehovah's evil Providence, I'll cast<br />
Into a sea embalmed in endless frost!"</td></tr></table>

<tr><td>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A witch dwelt high upon stern Endor's cliff.</span><br />
The place was dark: for night had drawn the veiling<br />
Between the mountain peaks that stand still, stiff,<br />
The frozen sentinels of Time; and sailing<br />
Aloft upon the evening air, the smoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span><br />
Of hostile camp-fires blackened e'en the night.<br />
Here dwelt this hag to horrid witchcraft given,<br />
A withered, fangless thing whose mutterings spoke<br />
Of all the secrets of Hell's shadow-light.<br />
The wind was coldly wailing. Near her fire,<br />
She crouched. Behind her, through a passage riven<br />
By some swift thunderbolt of wrath divine,<br />
Appeared a man in closely wrapped attire.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Like some lithe snake she turned and cringed</span><br />
In fear and yet in anger: "By what sign,<br />
And wherefore come you here?" her lips half snarled.<br />
The man unwrapped his mantle deeply fringed;<br />
He threw a purse before her. "For this cost,<br />
Let thine unseen familiar call from rest<br />
The one I name to thee"&mdash;She rose all gnarled;<br />
And thus she spake: "Seek not to hide thy mien;<br />
My spirit tells me that thou art&mdash;" Her lean<br />
Hand grasped the splintered rock&mdash;"Thou art the King!<br />
And whom wouldst thou, my Lord, seek in this fane<br />
Of Chaldee calculations, law and ring?"<br />
"Serve me but well to-night; and be thou wise&mdash;<br />
Charm as I bid; and gratitude shall last<br />
All time from me to thee&mdash;fulfill this quest&mdash;"<br />
He paused his speech and glanced to either side&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span><br />
"Summon me Samuel. Let his spirit rise<br />
Upon the night in wreathèd, hazy guise."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The fire-embers faded red, and died;</span><br />
King Saul sat staring into sable space;<br />
The witch was mumbling by the fire-side<br />
Whence curled up wisps of smoke. His heart beat fast.<br />
Within the gray appeared a dim-lit face.<br />
In silent terror gazed the King. At last,<br />
Was audible a voice upon the wind:<br />
"What would'st thou, Saul? What would'st thou learn from me?"<br />
"Samuel, 'tis thou&mdash;" and then, as in a gust<br />
The storm sweeps down upon the plain, words burst<br />
In hot-lipped passion uncontrolled and fast&mdash;<br />
"Aid me; O, aid me; for I yearn, I thirst<br />
To drink this David's blood. The frenzied lust<br />
Of unfulfilled ambition desert-dry<br />
Burns in my throat. Is my seed barren cast<br />
On earth? Am I condemned to plod, a beast<br />
For any burden? Spectre, tell me why<br />
Should I be King of men, and yet the least<br />
Who cannot even hold or give mine own?"<br />
"The princely David shalt thou never gain;<br />
Thou dream'st a dream, O King, it is in vain&mdash;<br />

The spectre's voice swept on upon the wind;<br />
The spectre faded into argent gloom.<br />
Down shot a nacreous moonbeam dim-outlined.<br />
The King's eyes fell upon the armied plain.<br />
There rose a shout again, and yet again&mdash;<br />
Below was movement, battling of armed men,<br />
And shrieking clash of arms. How fiercely shines<br />
That flaring light! His camp was sheathed in flame!<br />
In flame that wrote upon his soul the lines:<br />
"Once fixed the star of forecast cannot wane;<br />
Thine all has been in vain, in vain, in vain&mdash;"<br />

<h2>THE PROPHECY OF SAINT MARK</h2>

<h3>A METRICAL SHORT-STORY</h3>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="table">
<tr><td>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Pale night upon its swift, aërial loom</span><br />
Wove the soft, vaporous substance of the gloom.<br />
The story-sculptured Gothic porch lay dim<br />
And silent in drab haze with which the spring<br />
Covers its carpentry of summer bloom.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A maiden stood within the porch's pale.</span><br />
"It is the night," she sighed, "Saint Marcus' night<br />
When ghosts of all foredoomed to sickness wing<br />
Into the church to pray; so runs the tale.<br />
Those who make no return shall feel the grim,<br />
Fell scythe of Death within the year. The light<br />
Must flicker up each face as past they sail.<br />
But Gascon, O my Gascon, shalt thou die?<br />
Year after year, I wait&mdash;Thy strong-wrought mail<br />
Surely is sword-proof&mdash;" And a hovering sigh<br />
Passed through her lips more still than silence, frail.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The lowering mist grew darker. From the womb</span><br />
Of day, young night was born. The paling light<br />
Was flecked with haze-clouds flickering in the gloom;<br />
And to and fro in stately pageantry,<br />
Strange shadow-shapes like liquid-silver spume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span><br />
Charmed into lightness, formed an imagery<br />
Of things half-human.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">Still the maiden pale</span><br />
Waited and hung upon each shadowy trail<br />
Of lingering vapors fainting to and fro.<br />
They took the shape of flitting forms in mail<br />
Or monkish cowl. A Merlin-magic spell<br />
Seemed laid upon her. "And art <i>thou</i> to go?"<br />
She whispered as some well-known face amid<br />
The rest swept by her through that portal fell.<br />
And some, not marked for Death, returned again;<br />
And some returned not. O'er the porch's rail,<br />
Leant her light body as she scanned each form,<br />
And tensely looked with terror anxious-eyed.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Why does she shrink with all-consuming pain,</span><br />
And seek to gaze again? A blinding storm<br />
Of anguish breaks upon her. "O what doom<br />
Is this for thee and me? Why doest thou glide<br />
Into this silent, terror-freighted tomb?"<br />
Pale Gascon's figure fled along the tide&mdash;<br />
Some forms not marked for Death returned again;<br />
But his returned not. Ever anguish-eyed,<br />
She paused and waited&mdash;waited in the gloom.<br />
At last the flying cloud flakes ceased to come;<br />
And stilly night arose. "My God, to whom<br />
May I turn now? My richest Self is rent!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Down from the carven doorway stumbling slow,</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span><br />
The maiden passed, silent with languishment.<br />
Forth from the darkness stepped a man. All dumb,<br />
She gazed in careless stupor such as woe<br />
Stamps on the soul.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">"My Lady, may I dare&mdash;"</span><br />
He paused, and gazed, bowed sweepingly and low,<br />
Then spoke again. She stood there sad and fair,<br />
Quivering like a heat-cloud in the air.<br />
"Lady, a traveler asks the way to where<br />
He may find rest and lodgement." One brief while,<br />
She stayed herself in stupor; 'tis but meet,<br />
A soul come slowly from behind the veil.<br />
"Come&mdash;come," she said, upon her face a smile<br />
Of sorrow blent with some strange joyance pale.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">They passed along the quaintly cobbled street,</span><br />
And then turned through a lane where high up-reared,<br />
The gloomy oaks and hawthorne hedges greet<br />
The eye on either hand. A cottage stood<br />
With banks of sleepy flowers at its feet;<br />
And all around, the giant, hoary wood<br />
Frowned down its shadows on the garden's bloom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span><br />
Frowned down, a fateful harbinger of gloom.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Within the cottage, all was warmth and cheer.</span><br />
There stayed the mother waiting the return<br />
Of her sweet child. They entered. She did greet<br />
Both with an all-inclusive smile, and clear,<br />
Unchanging peace and kindliness that burn<br />
Before a pure soul's shrine. "Whom have we here,<br />
Marie?&mdash;Some houseless stranger gone astray?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He doffed his feathered cap and bowed full low.</span><br />
"After long twilight wanderings in despair<br />
Of any hermitage for night, not far<br />
From here, I prayed your daughter's guidance ere<br />
The dark should leave me but a chance faint star<br />
By which to fare."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Beside the oaken board,</span><br />
They sat and ate the rustic dishes there,<br />
While young Sir Guy poured forth a glittering hoard<br />
Of warriored stories gathered far away:<br />
How one brave knight pierced twenty paynim through;<br />
And how another fled from the affray<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span><br />
To be enslaved by Sarazain corsair.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The maiden hungered for each word. How frail</span><br />
Be warriors' lives! Upon the thought, she knew<br />
A bitter memory of forecast's gloom.<br />
Oh, she must fly. Oh, something must avail<br />
To give her refuge from this festering sting.<br />
She tried to turn her mind from sorrow's trail,<br />
And gave her thoughts to the narrator's tale.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Now he was speaking of a lord who strove</span><br />
To win his lady; but the Christian war<br />
Called him to battle for his Faith. He clove<br />
Damascus steel and clinking casques; but e'er<br />
He could return&mdash;Sir Guy then ceased; for here<br />
Arose a warning on the mother's brow.<br />
She wished no bitter recollections. Fear<br />
For Marie's plausance was her only care.<br />
Soon all the cottage slept 'mid the garden's bloom;<br />
And fatefully the forest frowned its gloom.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The summer blossomed, faded, and then died;</span><br />
And still as if enchanted, stayed he there.<br />
They took long walks o'er lonely hill and dale,<br />
And went across the fields with flowers pied.<br />
At times their voices rang upon the air;<br />
But ever when they came upon that vale<br />
Where, in its flowery charm, the cottage stood,<br />
Their talk would fail within the vasty wood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span><br />
Thus bathed their souls in summer's sultry tide<br />
Like flashing moths upon the wind that ride.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And hectic autumn came and brought its charm</span><br />
Of leafy brilliance heralding its death.<br />
Beside the evening blaze, full many a tale<br />
He told of knights in chivalrous career;<br />
But never raised the fluttering alarm<br />
Of the maiden's mother by the faintest breath<br />
Of the warrior lord and his loved one dear.<br />
Then hoary, chilling winter shrouded pale,<br />
Came, and passed by: thus wandered on, the year.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The spring was coldly wrapped in sullen haze;</span><br />
Even the mounting sun seemed scarce as warm<br />
As during winter. Slowly passed the days<br />
Until the Eve of blest Saint Marcus came.<br />
Among the misty-shadowed forest ways,<br />
Sir Guy did bring the maiden arm in arm.<br />
How oft the times that they had done the same&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"I've lived a life, careless and debonair,</span><br />
And know nor fettering bonds nor fear;<br />
Yet would I leave it all without a care&mdash;"<br />
She upward glanced and then glanced down as pale<br />
As any flowing haze-wreath in the gloom.<br />
"Oh, what is that?" she cried. The misty veil<br />
Parted and showed a glimpse of rock-built wall.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span><br />
"'Tis but the village kirk," he said. A pall<br />
Of haze enwrapped them like the Will of Doom.<br />
She stood and faced him, quivering as a sail<br />
That blows uncertain in a varying wind.<br />
"Marie, Marie," he faltered. Then a flare<br />
Of passion burnt his soul out in his eyes.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Downward she glances seeming unaware;</span><br />
But in her heart beneath the outward guise,<br />
Warring emotions make her spirit quail.<br />
Gascon's loved image into vision flies;<br />
And yet her rising love, she cannot quell<br />
For brave Sir Guy; and then, as when the flail<br />
Lashes the chaff, dim mist before her flies<br />
Into the church in Gascon's image pale.<br />
The year is out. What then, should <i>he</i> avail?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Marie&mdash;" Sir Guy is breathing on the air;</span><br />
She reads the rest within his flaming eyes.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Yes&mdash;yes," she murmurs.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 13em;">"O despair, despair!</span><br />
I have no hope; you fell into the snare!"<br />
His eyes dilated with mad light, he cries.<br />
"I, I am Gascon whose memory you dare<br />
To flout for any knight who stays a year<br />
Within your sight! I am undone. My doom<br />
Is set. These fateful forests be my bier!<br />
Your lover is a wreath of shadowy air&mdash;<br />
Go, search him in the western tempest's lair!<br />
For me, I hasten from this mortal gloom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span><br />
Sound mine own knell, and say mine own last doom!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">She shrinks away, with inward tumult pale.</span><br />
His voice is still. She hears a something fall.<br />
With anguish in her eyes, she turns. There, all<br />
Stretched out upon the ground, he lies. A well<br />
Of ruby richness pulses with his frail,<br />
Departing breath. In Merlin-magic spell<br />
Of agony, she stares into the gloom.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Pale figures, children of the mist-waves' womb</span><br />
In through the church's doorway seem to sail;<br />
Spectral, they vanish in their destined tomb.<br />
She moves; she starts; she cries, as one to whom<br />
Has come the horrid messenger of doom:<br />
"Is that <i>my</i> figure floating in the gloom?<br />
Shall my life fail; is this its funeral knell?"<br />
Pale night upon his swift, aërial loom,<br />
Wove the soft, vaporous substance of her doom.<br />

Until my soul could moan with pain&mdash;<br />
Oh, wherefore should she spurn<br />
My love again, and yet again?<br />
<br />
I toss upon my couch by night;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I yearn; I yearn&mdash;</span><br />
Until I see the glimmering light<br />
Upon the east return&mdash;<br />
Until with passion-pulsing breath,<br />

"Oh, let me win thee, sweetest Death&mdash;"<br />

<h2>THE PALACE OF PAIN</h2>

<h3>A CYCLE</h3>


<h4>I</h4>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="table">
<tr><td>
A soul was once incarnate in a man;<br />
And this unseen, incarnate thing was mine;<br />
And, as my body grew, the soul began<br />
To sip more fondly of the scented wine<br />
And sugared blisses life can give at call.<br />
It languished amid luxuries divine<br />
Showering richly like the leaves that fall<br />
Upon the sensuous-silent autumn air.<br />
Pale, fleeting Pleasure took my thoughtless all;<br />
For love, unselfish, passion-fervid, rare,<br />
Vibrated through the discords of dull time,<br />
Blending them into harmony; for where<br />
Life jangled harsh, a mother's care would chime<br />
More blissful chords than can be told in rime.</td></tr></table>

<h4>II</h4>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="table">
<tr><td>
The gentle harmonies of love declined,<br />
And swooned into a dull, funereal moan,<br />
And faintly floated onward with the wind.<br />
The symphony was gone; I stayed alone<br />
In all-enshrouding, opiate sadness bound.<br />
I did not scream; I did not weep nor groan.<br />
My soul was locked in stupor whence it found<br />
Only barred gates across dim vaults; and jangling,<br />
Discordant chaos stung me like a wound.<br />
I could not think; I could not hope; the wrangling<br />
Of jarring sounds oppressed me till my brain<br />
Was lost within a labyrinth, all-entangling&mdash;<br />
But this I learned although my powers did wane;<br />
That Love through Death transmutes itself to pain.</td></tr></table>

<h4>III</h4>

I sank my soul upon a sea of dreams;<br />
I floated through aërial heights divine<br />
Where saffron clouds a-glint with amber beams<br />
Shimmering strangely, stretched in shining line.<br />
I winged my way to Heaven's very dome,<br />
And on Hell's portal read the horrid sign;<br />
I danced upon the wavelet's crested foam,<br />
And swept tempestuous on the stormy wind.<br />
On earth like some vague terror, did I roam<br />
While moaning misery pursued behind.<br />
Whene'er I sang, my song had one refrain<br />
With anxious care and artifice refined,<br />
Until my soul's accompaniment would wane<br />
And wax to one <i>motiv</i>: unending pain.</td></tr></table>

I broke my dungeon-sepulchre of dreams;<br />
I climbed the winding stair to palace halls<br />
Where all the air was soothed by incense-streams;<br />
And every sight within those magic walls<br />
Was bright with radiant, opalescent sheen<br />
While lulling on the ear, light music falls<br />
Of such a melody as ne'er has been<br />
Unless by fays on fairy lyres played.<br />
There Pleasure gowned in iridescent green,<br />
Reclines upon her couch with gems inlaid,<br />
And gently beckons with a sinuous arm&mdash;<br />
But all the sumptuous excesses fade;<br />
The walls seem dim; the music has no charm,<br />
For Pleasure's Palace is a place of harm.</td></tr></table>

I tore the veils from mysteries aside;<br />

Until the last, most distant answer sighed:<br />
"The spirit of the world is pain, pain, pain&mdash;"<br />
Then from the drowsy distance, there did well<br />
A voice as of a witch before her fane,<br />
Soft-muttering, some Heaven-blasting spell:<br />
"The world is all in vain, the merest tool<br />
Of accident, an anteroom to Hell,<br />
A counterfeit but fairly glinting pool&mdash;<br />

I searched the winding, labyrinthine halls,<br />

Upon my weary spirit, came once more<br />
